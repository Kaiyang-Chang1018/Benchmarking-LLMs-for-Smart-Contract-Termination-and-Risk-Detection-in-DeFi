        // This segment is to get a reasonable initial estimate for the Babylonian method. With a bad
        // start, the correct # of bits increases ~linearly each iteration instead of ~quadratically.

        // Let `y = x / 2**r`. We check `y >= 2**(k + 8)`
        // but shift right by `k` bits to ensure that if `x >= 256`, then `y >= 256`.

        // Goal was to get `z*z*y` within a small factor of `x`. More iterations could
        // get y in a tighter range. Currently, we will have y in `[256, 256*(2**16))`.
        // We ensured `y >= 256` so that the relative difference between `y` and `y+1` is small.
        // That's not possible if `x < 256` but we can just verify those cases exhaustively.

        // Now, `z*z*y <= x < z*z*(y+1)`, and `y <= 2**(16+8)`, and either `y >= 256`, or `x < 256`.
        // Correctness can be checked exhaustively for `x < 256`, so we assume `y >= 256`.
        // Then `z*sqrt(y)` is within `sqrt(257)/sqrt(256)` of `sqrt(x)`, or about 20bps.

        // For `s` in the range `[1/256, 256]`, the estimate `f(s) = (181/1024) * (s+1)`
        // is in the range `(1/2.84 * sqrt(s), 2.84 * sqrt(s))`,
        // with largest error when `s = 1` and when `s = 256` or `1/256`.

        // Since `y` is in `[256, 256*(2**16))`, let `a = y/65536`, so that `a` is in `[1/256, 256)`.
        // Then we can estimate `sqrt(y)` using
        // `sqrt(65536) * 181/1024 * (a + 1) = 181/4 * (y + 65536)/65536 = 181 * (y + 65536)/2**18`.

        // There is no overflow risk here since `y < 2**136` after the first branch above.
        z := shr(18, mul(z, add(shr(r, x), 65536))) // A `mul()` is saved from starting `z` at 181.

        // Given the worst case multiplicative error of 2.84 above, 7 iterations should be enough.
        z := shr(1, add(z, div(x, z)))
