*******************************************************************************/

// Note that the following tokens are unsupported by the Vault. This list is not meant to be exhaustive, but covers
// many common types of tokens that will not work with the Vault architecture. (See https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20
// for examples of token features that are problematic for many protocols.)
//
// * Rebasing tokens (e.g., aDAI). The Vault keeps track of token balances in its internal accounting; any token whose
//   balance changes asynchronously (i.e., outside a swap or liquidity operation), would get out-of-sync with this
//   internal accounting. This category would also include "airdrop" tokens, whose balances can change unexpectedly.
//
// * Double entrypoint (e.g., old Synthetix tokens, now fixed). These could likewise bypass internal accounting by
//   registering the token under one address, then accessing it through another. This is especially troublesome
//   in v3, with the introduction of ERC4626 buffers.
//
// * Fee on transfer (e.g., PAXG). The Vault issues credits and debits according to given and calculated token amounts,
//   and settlement assumes that the send/receive transfer functions transfer exactly the given number of tokens.
//   If this is not the case, transactions will not settle. Unlike with the other types, which are fundamentally
//   incompatible, it would be possible to design a Router to handle this - but we didn't try it. In any case, it's
//   not supported in the current Routers.
//
// * Tokens with more than 18 decimals (e.g., YAM-V2). The Vault handles token scaling: i.e., handling I/O for
//   amounts in native token decimals, but doing calculations with full 18-decimal precision. This requires reading
//   and storing the decimals for each token. Since virtually all tokens are 18 or fewer decimals, and we have limited
//   storage space, 18 was a reasonable maximum. Unlike the other types, this is enforceable by the Vault. Attempting
//   to register such tokens will revert with `InvalidTokenDecimals`. Of course, we must also be able to read the token
//   decimals, so the Vault only supports tokens that implement `IERC20Metadata.decimals`, and return a value less than
//   or equal to 18.
//
//  * Token decimals are checked and stored only once, on registration. Valid tokens store their decimals as immutable
//    variables or constants. Malicious tokens that don't respect this basic property would not work anywhere in DeFi.
//
// These types of tokens are supported but discouraged, as they don't tend to play well with AMMs generally.
//
// * Very low-decimal tokens (e.g., GUSD). The Vault has been extensively tested with 6-decimal tokens (e.g., USDC),
//   but going much below that may lead to unanticipated effects due to precision loss, especially with smaller trade
//   values.
//
// * Revert on zero value approval/transfer. The Vault has been tested against these, but peripheral contracts, such
//   as hooks, might not have been designed with this in mind.
//
// * Other types from "weird-erc20," such as upgradeable, pausable, or tokens with blocklists. We have seen cases
//   where a token upgrade fails, "bricking" the token - and many operations on pools containing that token. Any
//   sort of "permissioned" token that can make transfers fail can cause operations on pools containing them to
//   revert. Even Recovery Mode cannot help then, as it does a proportional withdrawal of all tokens. If one of
//   them is bricked, the whole operation will revert. Since v3 does not have "internal balances" like v2, there
//   is no recourse.
//
//   Of course, many tokens in common use have some of these "features" (especially centralized stable coins), so
//   we have to support them anyway. Working with common centralized tokens is a risk common to all of DeFi.

/**

 * because the underlying stETH token is rebasing, and such tokens are unsupported by the Vault. They may also be
 * tokens like sEUR, which track an underlying asset, but are not yield-bearing. Finally, this encompasses
 * yield-bearing ERC4626 tokens, which can be used to facilitate swaps without requiring wrapping or unwrapping
 * in most cases. The `paysYieldFees` flag can be used to indicate whether a token is yield-bearing (e.g., waDAI),
 * not yield-bearing (e.g., sEUR), or yield-bearing but exempt from fees (e.g., in certain nested pools, where
 * yield fees are charged elsewhere).

/**
 * @dev Interface of the ERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in
 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[EIP-2612].
 *
 * Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by
 * presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't
 * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.
 *
 * ==== Security Considerations
 *
 * There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature
 * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be
 * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have
 * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should
 * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be
 * generally recommended is:
 *
 * ```solidity
 * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {
 *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}
 *     doThing(..., value);
 * }
 *
 * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {
 *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of
 * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also
 * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).
 *
 * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so
 * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.

     * @notice Saves the user or contract that initiated the current operation.
     * @dev It is possible to nest router calls (e.g., with reentrant hooks), but the sender returned by the Router's
     * `getSender` function will always be the "outermost" caller. Some transactions require the Router to identify
     * multiple senders. Consider the following example:
     *
     * - ContractA has a function that calls the Router, then calls ContractB with the output. ContractB in turn
     * calls back into the Router.
     * - Imagine further that ContractA is a pool with a "before" hook that also calls the Router.
     *
     * When the user calls the function on ContractA, there are three calls to the Router in the same transaction:
     * - 1st call: When ContractA calls the Router directly, to initiate an operation on the pool (say, a swap).
     *             (Sender is contractA, initiator of the operation.)
     *
     * - 2nd call: When the pool operation invokes a hook (say onBeforeSwap), which calls back into the Router.
     *             This is a "nested" call within the original pool operation. The nested call returns, then the
     *             before hook returns, the Router completes the operation, and finally returns back to ContractA
     *             with the result (e.g., a calculated amount of tokens).
     *             (Nested call; sender is still ContractA through all of this.)
     *
     * - 3rd call: When the first operation is complete, ContractA calls ContractB, which in turn calls the Router.
     *             (Not nested, as the original router call from contractA has returned. Sender is now ContractB.)
