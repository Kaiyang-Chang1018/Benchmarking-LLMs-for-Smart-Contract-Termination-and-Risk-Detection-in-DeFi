 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}

//   * The rules for the game are simple:
//
//     1. Players must buy a ticket and press the Telegram Bot button to play.
//     2. Each time a player presses the button, the countdown timer increases by 5 minutes (up to a limit of 30 minutes).
//     3. If the countdown timer reaches zero, the last player to press the button wins the jackpot.
//     4. The jackpot, starting at 1 ETH, is made of 50% of the ticket sales and token taxes. 50% of all tickets sold are burned, while the other half is swapped for ETH and added to the jackpot.
//        Similarly, half of the tax on the token is also sent to the jackpot.
//     5.  When a player wins the jackpot, he receive 50% of the current total, and the remaining 50% stays in the contract to continue growing the jackpot from game to game.
//     
//      Good luck!
