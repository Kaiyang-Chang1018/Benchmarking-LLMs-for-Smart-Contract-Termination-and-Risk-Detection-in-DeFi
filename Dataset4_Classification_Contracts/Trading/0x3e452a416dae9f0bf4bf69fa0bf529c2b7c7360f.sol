 *
 * The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override
 * this function so it returns a different value.
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

    // About dividendCorrection:
    // If the token balance of a `_user` is never changed, the dividend of `_user` can be computed with:
    //   `dividendOf(_user) = dividendPerShare * balanceOf(_user)`.
    // When `balanceOf(_user)` is changed (via minting/burning/transferring tokens),
    //   `dividendOf(_user)` should not be changed,
    //   but the computed value of `dividendPerShare * balanceOf(_user)` is changed.
    // To keep the `dividendOf(_user)` unchanged, we add a correction term:
    //   `dividendOf(_user) = dividendPerShare * balanceOf(_user) + dividendCorrectionOf(_user)`,
    //   where `dividendCorrectionOf(_user)` is updated whenever `balanceOf(_user)` is changed:
    //   `dividendCorrectionOf(_user) = dividendPerShare * (old balanceOf(_user)) - (new balanceOf(_user))`.
    // So now `dividendOf(_user)` returns the same value before and after `balanceOf(_user)` is changed.
